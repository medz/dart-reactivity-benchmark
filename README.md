> [!TIP]
> ## Ranking algorithm
>
> The ranking system evaluates frameworks based on multiple factors:
>
> 1. **Test Case Scores**
>    - For each test case, the fastest passing implementation (with coefficient â‰¥ 0.5) serves as the baseline
>    - Individual test scores are calculated as: `(baseline_time / actual_time) * coefficient * weight`
>    - Test case weights are assigned based on operation types:
>      - Regular operations: 1.0
>      - Extended operations: 1.2-1.5
>
> 2. **Success Coefficient**
>    - Full pass (coefficient = 1.0): Test completely successful
>    - Partial pass (coefficient = 0.5): Part of the test failed
>    - Complete fail (coefficient = 0): Test failed entirely
>
> 3. **Final Score Calculation**
>    - Base score: Geometric mean of all weighted test case scores
>    - Time factor: sqrt(fastest_total_time / framework_total_time)
>    - Final score = base_score * time_factor
>
> This scoring system balances individual test performance with overall execution time while accounting for test reliability.
